# =========================================== create bigwig file with composition bias scaling factors from csaw in R =========================================== #

#create bigwig file from sorted.bam (bam files must be sorted and indexed prior to bigwig creation) (-p # of cores), use csaw or spike-in scaling factors to normalization
bamCoverage -p (number of cores) -b file_sorted.bam -o file.bw --scaleFactor (number  generated by csaw or other normalization strategy) --binSize (1 for TFs, 10 for histone marks, sets resolution. Default is 50bp)
