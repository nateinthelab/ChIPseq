# =========================================== create bigwig file with composition bias scaling factors from csaw in R =========================================== #

#create bigwig file from sorted.bam (bam files must be sorted and indexed prior to bigwig creation) (-p # of cores), use csaw or spike-in scaling factors to normalization
bamCoverage -p (number of cores)
            -b file_sorted.bam 
            -o file.bw 
            --scaleFactor (number  generated by csaw or other normalization strategy) 
            --binSize (10 for TFs, 20 for histone marks, sets resolution. Default is 50bp)
            --smooothLength (averages adjacent bins to have smoother transitions between bins. Set to 30 for TFs and 60 for histone marks, with respective binSizes of 10 and 20 for TF and histones)
