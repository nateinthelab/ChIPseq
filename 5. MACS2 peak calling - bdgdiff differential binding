# ============================================== macs2 ============================================== #
## macs2 was used to call peaks (normally use default settings which call narrow peaks for TFs, and --broad for calling broad peaks on histone modif. For H3K4me3, use narrow peaks. 
## use -f BAMPE for paired end reads (just -f BAM for single end reads). 
## Sorted bam files needed for PE peak calling. -B is to provide .bdg (bedgraph file). Set less strict pvalue (like 0.003) to have many peaks, and this will help add complextity to data for diffbind

  ## run above code and see which p-value (pscore is log10-pvalue, so do 10^-pscore to determine 
  ## p-value) is most suitable to have highest number of peaks with lowest background (lowest p-value), then run code below

# ============================================== differential peak calling with macs2 bdgdiff ============================================== #
# github.com/macs3-project/MACS/wiki/Call-differential-binding-events
# 1. After peak calling, find value for "fragments after filtering in control" and "fragments after filtering in treatment" from excel sheet. 
  2. These values are the number of tags/fragments that were used after removing input/IgG signal or treatment. 
  3. These values are important as they will be used to normalize differential peak calling between samples by their read depth. 
  4. Write/record this value for each respective file you wish to compare. -g in bdgdiff is to specify gap length

# when peak calling, need to use -B to generate bedgraph file. Need to also use --nomodel and --extsize 120 (for transcription factors) or 150 (for histone marks)

# there will be 3 output files generated. common = peaks that are enriched in both conditions with no significance between conditions. last column in file is the difference between sample1 and sample 2 in log10 likelihood rations. cond1 = peaks that were enriched in sample 1 vs sample 2. cond2 = peaks that were enriched in sample 2 vs sample 1. 

# Before using .bed files for annotation or other analysis, you must remove first row. Use:
tail -n +2 inputfile.bed > outputfile.bed
